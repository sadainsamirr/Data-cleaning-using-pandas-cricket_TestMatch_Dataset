# Data Cleaning Using Pandas: Cricket Test Match Dataset

This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing cricket test match data using Python's pandas library. The dataset contains information about test match performances of various players, including statistics like runs scored, centuries, strike rate, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of test match statistics of cricket players. It includes columns such as:

- Player: Name of the player
- Span: Playing span of the player
- Matches: Number of matches played
- Runs: Total runs scored
- Highest Score: Highest score achieved
- Batting Average: Batting average

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: Filling or dropping missing values in relevant columns.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate rows based on specific criteria.
3. **Extracting Useful Information**: Extracting additional features from existing columns, such as country code from player names.

This project aims to provide a clean and well-prepared dataset for further analysis and visualization tasks. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
